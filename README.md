## What is the Library Application?

Library application is a software program designed to help users manage a library's collection of books. It is a web-based application built using the NodeJs to manage a library's collection of books and authors.

## Technologies

- Node.js: A powerful JavaScript runtime environment that allows the execution of JavaScript code on the server-side.
- Express: A fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js that provides robust routing and middleware capabilities.
- MongoDB: A popular NoSQL database program that uses a document-oriented data model to store data in a flexible, JSON-like format.
- Cyclic: A lightweight and efficient task scheduler for Node.js that allows for the execution of recurring tasks at specified intervals.

The backend of the Library Application is built using Node.js and Express, providing a reliable and efficient server-side infrastructure. Node.js enables the execution of JavaScript code on the server, allowing for seamless communication between the frontend and backend components.

Express, a minimalistic and flexible web application framework, is utilized to handle routing and middleware functionalities. It simplifies the process of creating robust APIs and managing HTTP requests, making development faster and more efficient.

For data storage and retrieval, MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database, is employed. MongoDB's document-oriented data model allows for flexibility in storing and querying data, making it suitable for the library application's needs. It provides a JSON-like format that aligns well with JavaScript objects and simplifies data manipulation.

By utilizing these technologies, the backend of the Library Application provides seamless integration with the frontend, efficient data storage and retrieval with MongoDB, and reliable task scheduling with Cyclic. Together, these components form a robust and scalable backend infrastructure that powers the library management functionality of the application.

## Let's begin

1. Clone on your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/awanthairushan/library-app-backend.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
```bash
cd library_app_backend
```
3. Install the project dependencies.
```bash
npm install
```
4. create a database using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/basics/create-database)
```bash
npm install
```
5. create .env file
```bash
PORT=4000
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3005
# Copy the connection string that created using mongoDB server and paste it below. 
CONNECTION_STRING=<connection string>
```
6. After completing, run the application
```bash
node index.js
```

## Suggestions for implementing 

As the Library Application continues to evolve, there are several exciting features and improvements that can be implemented in the upcoming version, Library Application 2.0. These additions aim to enhance security, user experience, and overall functionality. Here are some feature suggestions for consideration:

- Private Routing and Authentication:
Implement a robust authentication system with private routing capabilities. This will ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive sections of the application, such as adding or deleting books and authors. By integrating authentication, the application can provide a secure environment for library management.

- User Profiles and Permissions:
Introduce user-profiles and permission levels to provide different access rights based on roles or user types. For example, administrators might have full access and control, while regular users may have restricted privileges. This feature will enable a more customized experience and improved user management within the application.

- Search and Filtering Functionality:
Enhance the search functionality to enable users to search for books and authors based on specific criteria such as title, author name, genre, or publication date. Implement advanced filtering options to refine search results, allowing users to find relevant information quickly and efficiently.

These feature suggestions aim to elevate the Library Application by improving security, customization, user experience, and data management. By considering these enhancements for Library Application 2.0, the application will continue to provide users with a modern and efficient solution for managing library collections effectively.
